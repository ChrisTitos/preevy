At Livecycle, we consider the security of our products a first priority. Preevy uses proven, industry standard tools and libraries to build and deploy your environments.

Preevy only uses your cloud provider or Kubernetes credentials to provision and connect to environments - it does not send or store the credentials.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in the tool, please report it to security@livecycle.io. This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available to all users before reporting and publishing the issue.
